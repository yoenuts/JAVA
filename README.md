# JAVA

Mar 6, 2023
hello, im getting to know Java. The book I use is Java Programming Problem Analysis to Program Design Fifth Edition. This one I'd stolen away to evade frequent renewals.
It was honestly quite intimidating as I'd never understood the concept behind objects classes, methods and what they'd meant. It took me a looot of time (each turn of page took 
about 5 minutes for me to comprehend) but I followed along and built from that day by day( not really, my commits dont lie!) . I started to appreciate the things I could do, little as they were
and hope to create Applet GUI before midterms end (ambitious, seeing how mentally strained I am at the pebbles being thrown day by day) I think that my appreciation for Java rooted
from my love for coffee hehe but kidding aside, it's the first I'd independently gone out to study something for myself, and I'd learned more than coding -- discipline, focus, hard work and 
disattachment. Disattachment from negative emotions--hopelessness, shame, and loathing. As hard as it may be, but I feel that I admire myself more and have gradually rid
myself of feeling insecure about others' progress vs mine because it's me vs me (i know that sounds cliche.) 

So, if you read this in the future, never ever EVER give up. Always remember why you're where you are. The tough times will pass.
